My daughter, wife and I just watched 'Love, Actually', which is not my favorite Christmas movie ('Scrooge' with Albert Finney) but it comes pretty close. What it lacks (slightly) in the true meaning of Christmas as a celebration of Christ's birth, it makes up for fantastic multiple story lines about people and love, with everything from the young handsome but too busy but highly successful single guy (the newly elected prime minister of England) who falls for one of his staff to the old, well established husband who's been phoning it in to his wife for many years and then does something stupid for Christmas with his assistant whose been flirting shamelessly for a while. For the most part they are all happy endings, although some are sad in how one woman allows her special needs brother occupy all her time, and a very joyous scene at the end. Overall a great movie and certainly in my top 3 Christmas movies of all time.
